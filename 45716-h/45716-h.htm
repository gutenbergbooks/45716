<small>FOR LITTLE CHILDREN</small></div>


<div class="figright" style="width: 236px;">
<img src="images/illus09b.jpg" width="236" height="233" alt="King David by W. J. Palmer" />
<div class="caption">KING DAVID.</div>
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">In</span> ages past God made the world: the earth, the sea, the
hills, the streams, the trees; the fish, birds and beasts; last
of all He made Adam, the first man,
and Eve his wife, and they lived in
the Garden of Eden. They were
quite good at first, but tempted by
Satan they ate the fruit of a tree
God told them not to eat, and that
brought sin into the world; they
could not live for ever now, they
must die; but that their souls might
go to heaven, God's own Son said
He would come down on earth and die to save them. God
said His Son should be born of Abraham's nation, and
should be one of the sons of the line of King David, who
sang the sweet psalms in praise of God.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Abraham was a good man, so good that God called him
His friend; and from him came the people called Jews. David
was one of their kings. God always keeps His word, but
He makes men wait till it is His time to do as He says;
and it was a long, long time after Abraham and David that
our Lord came to live among men.</p>

<p>At last God sent His angel Gabriel to a young maiden,
named Mary, who lived at a town called Nazareth, to tell
her that God loved her, and that she should have God's Son
for her own son. Our Lord would be her little babe. When
Mary saw the angel she was at first afraid, but he said to her,
"Fear not, Mary," and he told her that she must call the
child's name Jesus&mdash;that means Saviour&mdash;for He would save
the people from their sins. Then Mary must have been glad.
She said, "I am God's servant; may His will be done."
Mary was to be the wife of her cousin Joseph&mdash;they were
both of David's family&mdash;so the angel went and told him too,
that Mary should have God's Son for her own, and that he
must call the child Jesus.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 360px;">
<img src="images/illus11.jpg" width="360" height="503" alt="Mary and Joseph on way to bethlehem by CCK" />
<div class="caption">THE JOURNEY DOWN TO BETHLEHEM.</div>
</div>

<p>Joseph and Mary lived at Nazareth. At that time the
Jews were ruled over by the Romans, whose king was called
CÃ¦sar. He wanted to know how many people there were in
that land, so he said all the men and women of it must go
to their own towns to be counted. Now Mary and Joseph's
town was Bethlehem. It was a great way off, but they had
to go. It took days and days to get there, for they went
slowly, and when at last they came to the town they found
the inn full; there was no room for them, and they had to go
to a stable to sleep and eat and drink.</p>

<p>And that night God sent Mary her Son. She had no nice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
cradle to lay the Lord
in, but she had some
clothes to put on Him,
so she wrapped the
sweet babe in them,
and laid Him in a
manger, where the ox
and the ass fed.</p>

<p>How good it was of
our Lord to be born
a poor child for our
sakes, was it not? He
was the Son of God,
but to save men He
came down and was a
babe in a stable of
Bethlehem.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 325px;">
<img src="images/illus12.jpg" width="325" height="469" alt="shepherds and Jesus by W. S." />
<div class="caption">THE SHEPHERDS IN THE STABLE.</div>
</div>
<p>Winter had come,
the snow was on the
hills near Bethlehem,
and some shepherds
were keeping watch over their flocks at night for fear the
wolves or bears should come and hurt them, when suddenly
they saw a great light in the dark sky, and from it a bright
angel came down close to them, and they were much afraid.
But the angel said, "Fear not, for I bring you good tidings"&mdash;that
is, news&mdash;"of great joy which shall be to all people.
For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a
Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this is how
you will know Him: you shall find the babe wrapped in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
swaddling clothes lying in a manger." And then a great
many angels came out of the light and sang, "Glory to God
in the highest, and on earth
peace; good-will to men."
The song ended, they went
back to heaven, and the
shepherds said, "Let us go
to Bethlehem, and see this
great thing of which the
Lord has told us." And
they made haste, and found
Mary and Joseph, and the
babe lying in a manger.
And the shepherds praised
God, and told the people
all that they had seen and
heard. The Son of God
had no nice soft cradle as
you had; He was laid in a
manger from which the ox
and ass fed: He chose to be
a poor child for our sakes.</p>



<p>Mary gave the name of Jesus to the babe as God had
told her, and when He was six weeks old she and Joseph
brought Him to God's Temple to present Him to the Lord,
and to give two doves to show her thanks for the child God
had sent to her. There was an old and good man at that
time, to whom God had promised that he should not die till
he had seen the Lord's Son; and now God's Holy Spirit
told him that the Child was in the Temple; and the old man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Simeon, went there and took the Babe in his arms, and
thanked God, and said that now he should die in peace, for
he had seen the Saviour. And Simeon blessed Joseph and
Mary, but he told her that men would speak ill of her Child.
Then a good old woman&mdash;her name was Anna&mdash;came in;
she was day and night praying in the Temple, and God let
her, too, know that this Child was God's Son, come to save
men; and she was glad, and gave God thanks, and told
every one that the Christ was come.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 584px;">
<img src="images/illus13.jpg" width="584" height="340" alt="Simeon lifting Baby Jesus with Anna, Mary and Joseph looking on by F.P" />
<div class="caption">THE PRESENTATION OF OUR LORD IN THE TEMPLE.</div>
</div>

<p>The word Christ means anointed&mdash;that is, touched with
oil, as kings and priests were&mdash;and the Jews always spoke of
the Saviour who was to come as "the Christ," or "King."</p>

<p>Then Mary took the Child back to Bethlehem.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 381px;">
<img src="images/illus14.jpg" width="381" height="380" alt="drawing by Palmer" />
<div class="caption">ARRIVAL OF THE WISE MEN.</div>
</div>

<p>Now there were some Wise Men who lived a long way
off, and who knew a great deal about the stars. At that
time all the world expected that Christ would come, and these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
wise men had heard
that when He was
born they would see
a new star. One
night they saw a
bright one that they
did not know, and it
shone over the land
of the Jews. So they
set off at once to go
and see the new-born
King. It was a long
way to go; they rode
across the sands on
camels, and went on
and on to where the
star shone. At last they came to Jerusalem, and they
asked the people, "Where is He that is born King of the
Jews? for we have seen His star in the east, and are come
to worship him."</p>


<p>Now at that time the Romans had made a very bad, cruel
man, whose name was Herod, King of the Jews. When he
heard of the wise men and of what they wanted to know, he
was troubled; for he was afraid if the great King was born
that he (Herod) would not be King any longer. So he sent for
the chief priests and asked them where God had said that the
Christ should be born. He did not know himself, for he was
not a Jew. And the priests said that Christ should be born
in the little town of Bethlehem.</p>

<p>Then Herod sent for the wise men and asked them when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
they first saw the star; and he sent them to Bethlehem and
said: "When you have found the young Child bring me
word, that I may come and worship Him too."</p>

<div class="caption">THE FLIGHT INTO EGYPT.</div>
</div>

<p>But the cruel King meant to kill the Babe if he found him.
Then the wise men went to Bethlehem, and to their great
joy, the star that they saw in the east went before them till it
came and stood over where the young Child was.</p>

<p>Then the wise men went in, and saw the young Child and
Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshipped Him,
and gave Him rich gifts&mdash;gold and a sweet scent, and myrrh,
which is a kind of gum.
But God told them, in
a dream, not to return
to Herod, so they went
back to their own land
by another way. And
when they were gone,
the angel of the Lord
came to Joseph in a
dream, and told him to
rise, and take the young
Child and His mother
and flee into Egypt, for
Herod would seek for
the Babe to kill Him.
Joseph rose at once,
though it was night,
and took the Child and
His mother and made
haste to go to Egypt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">THE SEA OF GALILEE.</div>
</div>

<p>King Herod
was very angry
when he knew
that the wise
men were gone
home, and he
sent and had
all the babes
in Bethlehem
killed, from
quite babies up
to two years old.
He thought,
thus, that he
would be sure
to kill the Holy Child, but God did not let him, you know.</p>

<p>When this cruel King died, an angel came and told Joseph
to take the Child back again into His own land. And
Joseph took Him and Mary, and they went to live at
Nazareth, a town on the shore of the Sea of Galilee.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 561px;">

<div class="caption">JESUS IN THE TEMPLE.</div>
</div>

<p>And the Child grew strong and full of wisdom, and the
grace of God was on him. And when He was twelve years
old, He went up with Mary and Joseph to Jerusalem, to
keep the Passover&mdash;this was a feast that God had commanded
the Jews to keep, to remind them that He had
saved them from death, and set them free when they were
slaves in Egypt. They ate a lamb at it, and drank some
wine. When the feast was over, Mary and Joseph went
on their way home, but Jesus stayed behind in the city.
There were so many people going to Galilee that Mary did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
not miss her son till night; then she went to look for Him,
for she thought He must be with some friends; but she could
not find Him, and in great fear, she and Joseph went back
to the city to seek for Him. They did not find Him for
three days, and then they went to the Temple, and there He
was in the midst of the priests and learned men, listening to
them, and asking them questions. And they were all much
surprised at his great sense and wise answers. His mother,
also, was amazed; but she said to Him, "Son, why have you
done this? your father and I have sought You sorrowing."
And He said to them, "How is it that you sought me?
Did you not know that I must do My Father's business?"
He meant "God's business," but they did not know the
meaning of His words. Then He went home with them and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
obeyed them, and was a good, kind Son; but His mother
kept all these things in her heart. Jesus has shown all
children how to behave to their parents; to obey them and
be kind to them as He was.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus18.jpg" width="600" height="351" alt="landscape" />
<div class="caption">THE RIVER JORDAN.</div>
</div>

<p>Now about fifteen years after this time there came a man
in the wild part of the land, by the river Jordan, who cried
to the people, "Repent," that is, "Be sorry for your sins
and be good," "for the Kingdom of Heaven is near." This
man's name was John, and he was the cousin of Jesus. He
wore only a rough robe of camel's hair and a belt of leather
round his waist; he had never tasted wine; he fed on insects
called locusts, and wild honey.</p>

<p>Then all the people of Jerusalem, and in all the places
near, came to John, and said how sorry they were for their
sins, and he baptized them in the Jordan&mdash;that is, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
poured water on their heads as they stood in the stream as a
sign that God would wash their sins away&mdash;that is, forgive
them. But he told them all that he was not the Christ who
was to come. He said he was only a Voice to call them
from their bad ways and make them ready for the One that
was to come, whose shoes he was not good enough to untie.
At last, one day, Jesus came to be baptized, but John, who
knew how good He was, said, "No, I need to be baptized
by You. Why do You come to me?" But Jesus said, "It
was right to do so," and then John obeyed Him and baptized
Him. Our Lord had no sins to be forgiven, but He
wished to set us an example, always to do right. And as
He came up out of the river, the heavens opened, and the
Spirit of God, like a dove, came down and rested on Him,
and there came a voice from heaven, saying, "This is my
beloved Son in Whom I am well pleased." Then John
knew that Jesus was God's Son&mdash;the Christ.</p>

<p>After He had been baptized, Our Lord went into the
wild country, or wilderness, for forty days, and was tempted
by the wicked spirit, called the Devil. To tempt any one is
to try and make him wicked; but the devil could not make
our Lord say or do a wrong thing, although he tried
in every way that he possibly could, and so he left
Him.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 349px;">
<img src="images/illus20.jpg" width="349" height="498" alt="two men" />
<div class="caption">PHILIP AND NATHANAEL.</div>
</div>
<p>But Jesus came back to John the Baptist, and as He
came near the river, John said to those who stood by him,
"Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the
world." And he told them how he knew that Jesus was
the Son of God, by the voice from heaven and the dove
coming down on Him. Again, the next day as John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
stood with two of his disciples&mdash;that means, men who
were taught by him&mdash;Jesus came near, and John said,
"Behold the Lamb of God." And then the two disciples
of John followed Jesus. He turned and saw them, and
said, "What seek ye?" They said, "Master, where do
You live?" And He said, "Come and see," and He took
them to His house, and they stayed with Him all day. Now
one of them was called Andrew. He was so sure that Our
Lord was Christ, the Son of God, that he went and found
his own brother, Simon, and brought him to hear and know
this great teacher. A
good brother or sister
will always try to make
his or her own brother
know and love Our Lord.</p>


<p>The next day Our
Lord told Philip to follow
Him. And Philip
went to his friend Nathanael,
and said to him,
"We have found the
Lord who is Christ, He
is Jesus of Nazareth."
Nathanael said, "Can
any good thing come
out of Nazareth?" for
Nazareth was a very
bad town. Philip said,
"Come and see." He
knew that if his friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
saw and heard Jesus he would love Him. So he brought
Nathanael to Our Lord, and Jesus said, "Here is a
very good, true man." Nathanael said, "How do You
know me?" Jesus said, "Before Philip called you I saw
you when you were under the fig-tree." God can see us
always. So then Nathanael knew that Jesus must be the
Son of God&mdash;the King&mdash;for only the Son of God could
have seen him so far off; and he stayed with Our Lord as
the others did.</p>

<p>Now Jesus had five disciples with Him, and He left
the shores of the Jordan and went with his friends, John,
Andrew, Peter, Philip, and Nathanael, to a town called
Cana.</p>

<p>And three days after they came to it, there was to be
a wedding in Cana. The mother of Jesus was there, and
Our Lord and His disciples were invited to the marriage.
Now, you know the Lord Jesus and His mother were
poor, and no doubt the people who gave the feast were also
poor, for they had not enough wine to last till the end;
and when there was not any more the mother of Jesus
went to Him and said, "They have no wine." Jesus did
not say at once, "I will give them some;" He said, "What
have I to do with thee? My time has not yet come." But
His mother believed that He would help all the same; she
knew how good and kind He was. So she said to the
servants, "Do what He tells you."</p>

<p>Now there were some large stone jars or pots in the
room used for holding water, and Jesus said to the servants,
"Fill the water-pots with water." And they filled them up
to the brim. And then Our Lord told them to pour it out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and take it to the
man who was ruler
of the feast; for the
Jews used to get a
friend to see that
things went right at
their feasts, and he
was called the governor
or ruler.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 381px;">
<img src="images/illus22.jpg" width="381" height="321" alt="Mary and Jesus at wedding" />
<div class="caption">CHANGING THE WATER INTO WINE.</div>
</div>

<p>Now Our Lord
had changed the
water into wine, and
when the ruler of the
feast had tasted it he
sent for the bridegroom, and said to him, "You have kept
the good wine till now," for it was very good wine. But
the servants knew that it had been water, and they told
every one that Jesus had made it wine. This was the
first miracle&mdash;that is, wonderful thing&mdash;that Our Lord did
before all the people. It was a great miracle; and when
His disciples saw it they were sure that He must be the
Christ.</p>

<p>Why did our Lord do this wonderful thing? To be
kind, and to show men that He was God. There are
things men cannot do; but God can do them, and when
Jesus did them He showed men that He was God.</p>

<p>Soon after this, Our Lord went up to Jerusalem to keep
the Passover. He went to the Temple&mdash;God's house in
which He was worshipped; and where every day they killed
a lamb and burnt it on the altar. The lamb was offered up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
that God might forgive the sins of the people. So when
John the Baptist said, "Here is the Lamb of God," he
meant that Our Lord would die, as the Temple Lamb did, to
save men from their sins.</p>

<div class="caption">TURNING OUT THE MONEY CHANGERS.</div>
</div>

<p>But when our Lord came into the Temple He was very
angry. For He saw in it oxen and sheep, doves and
pigeons waiting to be sold to people for sacrifice, and tables
with heaps of money on them that came from all lands; for
the men whose the tables were, changed the gold of far off
countries for the Jew's money. Do you not think it was very
wrong of men to bring oxen, and lambs, and money to change
into God's House? Our Lord was very angry to see it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
He made a whip of small cords and drove out the oxen and
sheep; and He upset the tables of money, and the seats of
those who sold doves, and said, "Take these things away.
Do not make my Father's house a place to buy and sell in."</p>

<p>The men whom the Lord drove out were very angry, but
they knew that He was quite right, and so they did not
strive against Him. But the priests, who ought not to have
allowed such things, came to Jesus and said, "Give us some
sign, you have a right to do this." They meant, do some
miracle.</p>

<p>But our Lord would not do a miracle for them. He said
the only sign that should be given them was, that if they
killed Him He would rise again in three days. But they
did not know what His words meant.</p>

<p>While Jesus was here a very good and wise rich man,
named Nicodemus, came to see Him by night. He did not
go to see Jesus in the daytime, because he was afraid of
the Jews; but Our Lord taught him a great many things.
Among others, that God so loved the World that He
gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believed in
Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God
sent His Son into the World that through Him it might
be saved.</p>

<div class="caption">NICODEMUS BEING TAUGHT BY CHRIST.</div>
</div>

<p>Then Jesus left the City, and went about teaching
and doing good, healing the sick, making the blind
see, and the deaf hear, and so He came to Samaria.
Now the Jews hated the people who lived there; and
the Samaritans hated the Jews. Our Lord never hated any
one. He loved both the good and the bad, and came to
save all. Of course God loves good men or good children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a><br /><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>best; Our Lord loved His Apostle John best of all, but He
does good to all men, and lets His sun shine on all alike.</p>

<p>One day Our Lord was very tired; He had been teaching
the poor and making the sick well, and He had walked
a long way, and He wanted food. So He sat down on the
stone edge of an old well in Samaria, while the disciples went
to buy food, and while He sat there a woman came from the
town with a jug to draw water. And Jesus said to her,
"Give me some to drink." But she said, "How is it that
you, who are a Jew, ask me, who am a Samaritan, for
drink? for the Jews will not have anything to do with the
Samaritans." Jesus told her that if she had but known Who
it was that asked her for drink, she would have begged Him
to give her living water. The woman said, "You have not
anything to draw the water in, and the well is deep. How
can you get living water? Are you greater than our father,
Jacob, who gave us this well?" But Our Lord told her that
they who drank the water of that well would be thirsty again;
but that if she drank of the water He could give her she
should never thirst; it should give her life that would
not end.</p>

<p>What did Our Lord mean by living water? He meant
God's grace&mdash;that is&mdash;God's help to make us good. The
woman did not know what He meant, so she said, "Give me
this water that I may not have to come here to draw any
more." Then Our Lord told her of her sins; He knew that
she was not good; He knew all her past life, and He told
her about God, and that He must be worshipped in spirit
and in truth. The woman said, "I know that Christ will
come soon, and He will tell us all things."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Think how glad she must have been when Our Lord
said, "I, that speak unto you, am He."</p>

<p>Just then His disciples came, and they wondered that
He talked to a Samaritan woman. She left her water-pot,
and went to tell her
friends, and to ask
them to come and see
Jesus. The disciples
said to Our Lord,
"Master, eat;" they
had brought food;
but Jesus cared more
to do God's work
than to eat, though
He was hungry.</p>

<p>The woman
brought many of the
people of the town
to Our Lord, and
they believed that
He was the Christ,
and begged that He
would stay with them
and teach them; and
He did stay there for
two days. How good our Lord was to stay and teach these
poor men, to whom the proud Jews would not even speak.
Then Jesus went to Cana again where He had made the
water into wine; and a rich man who had a young son very
ill came to Him and begged Him to make his child well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Our Lord wanted
to try the man's faith,
so He did not say,
"Yes, I will," at
once. He said, "If
you do not see signs
and wonders you
will not believe."
But the man said
again, "Sir, do come
down or my son will

pitied him and said,
"Go thy way, thy
son liveth."</p>

<div class="caption">JESUS AND THE RICH MAN.</div>
</div>
<p>Jesus could cure
the sick boy without
seeing him. The
rich man had faith;
he believed Our Lord's words and went his way, but before
he reached his house his servants met him, and said, "Your
son is getting well." "When did he begin to get better?"
asked the father. "Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever
left him," they said. Then the father knew that it was at
the very same hour that Our Lord spoke that his son was
made well. And now Our Lord came to Nazareth where
He had been brought up, and He went into the synagogue&mdash;that
is the Jews' chapel&mdash;on the seventh day and He stood
up to read. The priest gave Him the book. It was that part
of the Bible where God told men what Christ would do when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
He came, how He would teach men, and comfort sad
people, and make blind men see. And when Our Lord had
read it He gave the book back to the priest, and said, "All
this has come true to-day." And He told them that He
was the Christ. At first they liked to hear Him preach, for
His words and voice were sweet; but when He told them
that He was Christ they grew very angry, and said, "Is not
this the carpenter's son? He is not Christ;" and they got up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and dragged Our Lord out of the town to the edge of the
hill on which their city was built, that they might cast Him
down headlong and kill Him. But it was not the time Jesus
meant to die, so He made them not able to see Him, and He
walked through the midst of them and went away.</p>

<div class="caption">PREACHING IN THE SYNAGOGUE.</div>
</div>

<p>You see what bad men lived in Nazareth. They drove
away the good, gentle Lord, who came to save them from
their sins, because they were proud and jealous of Him;
and He never again came to teach them. He went down
to Capernaum, another town by the Sea of Galilee, and
taught there and did many miracles, and it was called
His Town.</p>

<p>Our Lord had not His disciples always with Him
yet; John and James and Andrew and Peter had gone back
to their boats to fish; but now Jesus wished them to be
always with Him, so He called them again. I will tell you
how. One day when Jesus was on the sea-shore, such
crowds of people came to hear Him speak to them that
there was not room, and they pressed upon Him. There
were two large boats close to the shore; the fishers had
gone out of them and were washing their nets; so our Lord
went into one of them, which was Peter's, and asked him to
push the boat a little way out from the land. Then He sat
down and taught the people from the boat. And when He
had done speaking, He said to Peter, "Pull out into the
deep water and let down your nets to catch some fish."
But Peter said, "Master, we have toiled all night and have
not caught one fish; but still at Thy word I will let down
the net." Peter thought that it would be of no use to do so,
but still he would obey the Lord. So he threw the net into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the sea, and heaps and heaps of fishes came into it directly,
so many that the net broke.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 575px;">
<img src="images/illus31.jpg" width="575" height="307" alt="by W. J. M." />
<div class="caption">THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.</div>
</div>

<p>Then Peter called to the other boat, in which were his
partners, James and John, to help him, and they came and
filled both boats with fish; there were so many that the
boats began to sink.</p>

<p>When Simon Peter saw it he fell down at Our Lord's
feet, and said, "Go away from me, for I am a sinful man,
O Lord."</p>

<p>For he was afraid. But Jesus said to him, "Fear not;
from this time you shall catch men." What did that mean?
Peter knew, and James and John knew; it meant that they
must not fish any more, but come and try to draw men to the
Lord to make them good. They were quite sure now that
Our Lord was the Christ, so when they had brought their
boats to the shore, they left them and all they had, and went
with Jesus, and did not leave Him any more till the end came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>After Our Lord had been away for a time from Capernaum,
He went back there. As soon as the people heard
it they came in great numbers to the house Jesus was in, to
see and hear Him.</p>

<p>Now the houses in that land are not like ours: they have
flat roofs, on which you can walk or sit, and a staircase
outside the house leads up to it. Most of the houses&mdash;all
the large ones&mdash;have a court in the middle of them. The
people crowded into the court of the house where Our
Lord was, and He preached to them there. More and more
came in till there was no room, not so much as about the
door.</p>

<p>Now there was a poor man in the town who was sick of
the palsy, so that he could not move; and lay always on a
bed. He wished very much to go to Our Lord for help, and
his friends who loved him had him carried by four men on a
kind of bed to the house where the Lord Jesus was, but they
could not come near Him through the crowd. So they
carried him up to the roof, and took off enough of the tiles
to make room for them to let the bed down by ropes put at
each of the four corners, and thus they lowered it down with
him on it, right in the front of the Lord. He looked at the
sick man, and said, "Son, thy sins be forgiven thee." Jesus
knows all we think, and He knew the poor man wished
more to be forgiven for his sins than to be made well.
But some of the Jews&mdash;lawyers&mdash;who hated Our Lord,
thought to themselves, "How wickedly this man speaks.
Who can forgive sins but God only?" They did not think
the Lord could know their thoughts; but He did know
them, and He said, "Why do you think this in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
hearts? Is it easier to say to the sick man, Your sins are
forgiven, or to say, Arise, take up your bed and walk? But
that you may know that (I) the Son of Man have power on
earth to forgive sins, I will do so." And then our Lord said
to the sick man, who could not move, "Arise, and take up
thy bed, and go thy way into thine house." And the sick
man rose up and stood, and took up his bed and walked
out before them all. And they were amazed, and praised
God, saying, "We never saw anything like it before."</p>

<div class="caption">THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE SEA OF GALILEE.</div>
</div>

<p>After Our Lord had made the sick man well, He walked
down to the shore of the beautiful sea of Galilee. The crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
followed Him, and there in the fresh, sweet air, He went
on teaching them. Not far off was a place called the Receipt
of Custom. I will tell you for what it was used.</p>

<p>The Romans made the Jews pay them money, and this
was called a tax. They put men in some places to receive
this tax for them, and these men were called Publicans.
They were not good men generally, and the priests and
great men hated them; but some of them were just and
honest. Levi was; and we may be sure he had heard Our
Lord preach and loved Him, for one day, as he was sitting
at the place where men paid the tax to him, Our Lord went
up to him and said, "Follow Me." Levi must have known
who spoke to him, for he at once rose and was ready to give
up all his riches and go with Jesus. And he was so glad
that the Lord had called him that he gave a feast at his house,
and asked all his friends to come to it to meet their Saviour.
His friends were most of them Publicans like himself, and
not all good men; but Jesus and His disciples sat down
and ate with them.</p>

<p>Now some of the Jews hated Our Lord; these were the
Scribes and Pharisees. The Scribes were men who wrote
out the laws&mdash;there were no printed books in those days&mdash;so
they were thought wise; the Pharisees were a set of men
who pretended to serve God better than any other people, and
made a show of praying, saying their prayers in the streets to
be seen of men; but they were not really good. These men
came now, and said to Jesus, "How can You sit down to
eat with publicans and sinners?" Jesus said, "Men who
are well do not want a doctor, but those who are sick do. I
am not come to call good men to be sorry for their sins, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
bad men." The Pharisees did not know that they and all
men were sinners, and that all must be saved by Jesus.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus35.jpg" width="600" height="545" alt="by Auguste Laby" />
<div class="caption">THE RECEIPT OF CUSTOM.</div>
</div>

<p>Now I must tell you that Levi had two names, as you
have. His first name was Matthew, and a long time after,
he wrote the story of Our Lord's life. It is called the
Gospel&mdash;that means good news&mdash;of St. Matthew, and it is
in the Bible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Now just as the feast was ending there came a ruler and he
threw himself down at Jesus' feet, and said, "My daughter
is dying, but come and lay Your hands on her and she
shall live." This ruler's name was Jairus; he had great
faith. And Jesus rose up at once and went with him, and
so did His disciples. And as they went along the road a
poor woman who had been ill for years and had spent all her
money to pay doctors, who did her no good, crept softly up
behind Our Lord and just touched the hem of His robe, for
she said, "If I may but touch His robe I shall be well."
There was a great mob of people at the time and they
pressed up against Jesus, but He stopped, and said, "Who
touched Me?" Then Peter and the rest said, "Master, all
the people press on You; why do You ask 'who touched
Me?'" And Jesus said, "Some one has touched Me."
Then the woman came and knelt down, and said, "I did,"
and Jesus was pleased with her faith and told her to go in
peace, and she was quite cured. Then they went on to
Jairus' house. The little girl was dead; but Jesus took the
father and mother and Peter, James, and John with Him and
went in where she lay and took her little hand, and said,
"Maid, arise." And the little girl came to life and got up,
and Jesus told them to give her something to eat.</p>

<p>How glad her father and mother must have been to have
their dear child again, alive and well! How they must have
thanked and blessed Our Lord! All her friends would
always believe in Him now; and do you not think the little
girl&mdash;she was only twelve years old&mdash;must have loved the
Lord Jesus very much, and tried to be good to please
Him.</p>

<div class="caption">THE RAISING OF JAIRUS' DAUGHTER.</div>
</div>

<p>When Jesus left the
house where He had
raised the child from
the dead, two blind
men followed Him
crying, "Thou Son of
David, have mercy on
us." When they called
the Lord the Son of
David, they meant that
they believed He was
the Christ. And they
followed Him into the
house. And Jesus said
to them, "Do you
believe I can make
you see?" They said,
"Yes, Lord." Then
he touched their eyes
and said, "As your
faith is so be it unto
you." And their eyes were opened and they could see.
They had told the truth, they did believe in Jesus; if they
had said they did untruly they would not have been cured.
Our Lord told them not to let any one know it; but when
they were gone they told about it everywhere.</p>

<p>When Jesus went out again they brought to Him a
dumb man; Our Lord ordered him to speak and he did so.
Indeed no poor sick man came to Him in vain. He made
lepers well, and cured a man with dropsy; and made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
crooked woman straight. He made the dumb speak, the
deaf hear, the blind see, the cripple walk. We cannot in
this little book tell you half the kind, good, and wonderful
things Our Lord did while He was on earth.</p>

<p>And He sent His apostles also to teach the people, and
made them able to heal the sick and to do other miracles.
One day the disciples were angry because one who was not
a disciple cured a man in Christ's Name, but Our Lord
said, "Forbid him not, for even he who gives you a cup of
water in My Name, shall not lose his reward."</p>

<p>About this time there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus
went up to Jerusalem. Now there was at Jerusalem by the
sheep-market a pool of water which was called Bethesda,
that means House of Mercy. Round it were five porches
or doorways, and in these lay a great many poor sick men.</p>

<p>There was something wonderful about the pool. At
times in the year the water bubbled up&mdash;the Jews said an
angel made it do so. The first person who stepped into
the pool as it bubbled was cured at once. So many sick
men waited for the chance. One man was there who had
been crippled for thirty-eight years. The Lord Jesus walked
down one day to this pool, and when He saw the poor man
and heard how long he had been thus, He said to him, "Will
you be made well?" The helpless man thought Our Lord
meant, "Will you not go into the pool," for he answered,
"Sir, I have no man who will put me in when the pool is
bubbling, and while I try to get to it another man steps down
before me." It was, as you know, only the first who stepped
in after the water was troubled that was cured. Then Jesus
said, "Take up your bed and walk."</p>

<p>And the man who could not move at all at once rose,
took up his bed&mdash;a rug most likely&mdash;and walked.</p>

<p>Now it was the Sabbath day, and you know how strict
the Jews were about it. They said at once to the man who
was cured, "Why do you carry your bed on the Sabbath
day? it is forbidden by the law."</p>

<p>The man said, "He that made me well said to me,
'Take up your bed and walk.'"</p>

</div>
<p>When they asked him, "What man was it who told you
to do so?" But the man did not know, because Jesus had
gone away with the crowd.</p>

<p>Afterwards Jesus found him in the Temple and said to
him, "You are well now; do not sin again lest a worse thing
come on you."</p>

<p>The man must have been a sinner, and Jesus told
him to take care to be a better man, or God might punish
him with a worse illness, but he was so ungrateful that,
though he must have known the Jews would be angry with
Our Lord for making him well on the Sabbath day, he went
at once to them and told them that it was Jesus who had
made him well.</p>

<p>The priests were very angry, but Jesus said to them,
"My Father works on the Sabbath and so do I." Then
they wanted to kill Him, because he had not only done
a miracle on the Sabbath, but said that God was His
Father, making Himself equal with God.</p>

<p>And so, you know, He was; but these wicked Jews
would not believe it; they were jealous of Him because
the people loved Him, and angry because He told them how
wicked they were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>


<p>Our
Lord
told
His
disciples
one
day
this
pretty
parable. The Kingdom
of Heaven is like treasure&mdash;that
is, something
precious like gold or
gems&mdash;hid in a field, and
a man who knows about
it, and wishes to get it, sells
all that he has and buys
the field; the treasure is
then his and he digs it
up. In that country
much gold had been
hidden in the ground by
men who fled from their
enemies, and never came
back to dig it up again, and there were many who sought for it.</p>

<p>This parable means that the kingdom of God, the love
of Christ, and His help to make us good are so precious that
we should give up anything for them, and try as hard as we
can to gain them.</p>

<div class="caption">JESUS AND HIS DISCIPLES IN THE CORN-FIELD.</div>
</div>

<p>Our Lord and His disciples were poor, and sometimes
wanted food. One Sabbath day they were walking through
the corn-fields, and the disciples were hungry, so they picked
some ears of corn, rubbed them in their hands, and ate the
wheat.</p>

<p>The Jews might
eat corn in the fields
on week-days, but
the Pharisees had
made many hard
and silly rules about
the Sabbath day.
God had said that
they must keep the
seventh day holy;
but He meant it to
be a rest from work
and a day for men
to pray to Him, not
a day such as they
made it.</p>

<p>The Pharisees
said that no fire
might be lighted on
the Sabbath day,
no food cooked, not one thing might be done; they might
only walk a little way on that day; and doctors might not
cure or help the sick. So it was a day when men, and
children too, were not happy, as God meant them to be.</p>

<p>Now, when the Pharisees saw the disciples eat the corn, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
said, "Why do you do that which is not right on the Sabbath
day?" Our Lord answered, and told them that there was no
harm in His disciples eating the corn, for men must eat on
the Sabbath day, and that we might do needful things on it.
Then He went into the synagogue, and He saw there a man
with a withered hand. And the Jews said to Christ, "Is it
right to make men well on the Sabbath day?" And Jesus
said, "Yes, it is; for if a sheep fell into a pit on the
Sabbath day you would take it out, and a man ought to be
helped more than a sheep." And He told the poor man
to stretch out his hand; he did so, and found that Jesus
had made it well, and just like the other hand. And the
Pharisees were so angry because He had told men that they
were wrong, that they began to talk about killing Him.
But Jesus went away when
He knew it; and a great
crowd of people followed
Him, and He made all
the sick ones well.</p>

<p>One day, when He saw
how many there were following
Him, He wished
to teach them, and, that
they might hear Him well,
He went up on a mount
close by, and sat down.
The Jews always sat down
to preach. And when He
was seated, His disciples
came to Him, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
words He then spoke are called the Sermon on the Mount.
You will read it when you are older; it is too hard for you now,
but we may tell you a few things out of it. Jesus told them that
God would bless those who were humble&mdash;that is, not proud&mdash;and
the meek and gentle. He said that God would comfort
those who were sad; that He would bless those who were
kind; that the pure in heart should see God, and that those
who made up quarrels should be called God's children. He
told them that they need not "take thought" about how they
should get food and clothes. "See," He said, "the birds
of the air: God feeds them; He will also feed you; and look
at the lilies: they toil not, neither do they spin, yet the
grandest king in all his glory was not arrayed&mdash;that is,
dressed&mdash;like one of them. Seek to please God, and He will
take care of you." Then He taught them to say the prayer
"Our Father," just as you do now at your mother's knee.</p>

<p>When Jesus had ended the Sermon on the Mount, He
came down, and a great many people followed Him; and
there came a leper, and knelt down to Him, and said, "Lord,
if You will, You can make me clean."</p>

<p>A leper was a man whose flesh was eaten away by disease;
sometimes the fingers and feet of the leper would fall off. No
one could cure him, and men might catch the complaint, so the
lepers were kept in a place by themselves; and if they went into
the town, they had to cry as they went, "Unclean! unclean!"
We are sure that, when this leper came to Christ, all the
people got out of his way, and would not touch the poor man.
But Our Lord put out His kind hand and touched him, and
said, "I will; be thou clean;" and in a moment the leper
was quite well; and Our Lord told him to go to the priest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and offer a gift of thanks to God. No one but God can cure
a leper; but Jesus is God, and He could.</p>

<div class="caption">CHRIST AND THE CENTURION.</div>
</div>

<p>Now, when Our Lord had come to Capernaum, there
came a Roman, the captain of a hundred men, and begged
Him to make his servant well, for he was very ill with the
palsy. Our Lord said at once, "I will come and heal him."
But the Roman captain said, "Lord, I am not good enough
for You to come to my house, but speak the word only, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
my servant will be well." You see, this Roman had even
more faith than the rich man, whose son was ill. "For," the
Roman went on, "if I tell my servants to do anything,
they do it; and You, who rule all things, need only speak
to be obeyed." And Jesus wondered at the Roman's
words, and said, "Verily, I have not found such great faith,
no, not in Israel," and He said to the centurion, "Go
your way; and as you have believed so be it done unto
you." And the man went home, and found his servant
well.</p>

<p>Then Jesus went to Peter's house, and made his wife's
mother well of a fever, and healed many more sick, and
made the blind see and the deaf hear. We cannot, in this
little book, tell you half of the good and kind things Our
Lord did.</p>

<p>Jesus sometimes told His disciples lovely tales that
meant something more than just the story, so they were
called Parables. One of these was that the Kingdom of
Heaven is like a merchant who wanted to buy good pearls.
You know what pearls are, do you not? They are pure
white shining beads that men find in the shell of the oyster.
To get them the fishers have to go down to the bottom of the
sea; so, of course, they sell the pearls very dear. Now, when
the pearl-fishers had found a very large pearl of great price,
they took it to the merchant; it would cost a great deal, but
he knew it was worth even more; so he sold all he had and
bought it. Now this story means that God's Kingdom is
such a beautiful place, and that it is so good for us to serve
Christ here, that we should give up all that we most care for
to gain the love of God.</p>

<img src="images/illus47.jpg" width="564" height="421" alt="THE MIRACLE AT NAIN. by W. J. M." />
</div>

<p>One day, Our Lord, with His disciples and a great
crowd who followed Him, came near a little town called
Nain. And just as He drew near the gate of the city a dead
young man was brought out to be buried. His mother was
walking by the side of the bier and crying very much, for
her husband was dead, and she had no other son. And
when Our Lord saw her
He had pity on her, and said,
"Weep not," and He came and touched the bier, and the
men who were carrying it stood still. And Jesus said,
"Young man, I say unto thee, Arise!" And the dead
man came to life and sat up and began to speak, and the
Lord gave him to his mother. And there came a great
fear on all who saw it, and they said, "God has visited His
people."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Another parable Jesus told them was of a sower who
went out to sow seed. And as he cast the seeds about
some of them fell by the wayside; and the birds came and
ate them up; some fell on stony places where they had not
much earth to grow in, and they sprang up fast, because they
were not deep in the ground; but when the sun came out,
it burned them up quite dry, for they had no root; and some
fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up and choked them&mdash;that
is, did not leave them room to grow. But some fell
on good ground, and grew up and brought forth much fruit.</p>

<p>The Apostles did not quite know what hidden meaning
there was in this Parable, so Jesus told them.</p>

<p>The seed meant the Word of God; the sower, a servant
of God who had to teach the Word. The seed that fell by
the wayside meant that the words had not been cared for
by those who heard them, and the Wicked Spirit then made
them forget all they had heard. That which fell on stony
places and had no depth of earth, meant those who at first
are glad to hear of God's love, and seem as if they would be
His children; but their goodness has "no root," and so a
little trouble makes them give up trying. We must all ask
God to keep us Christ's children. The seed that fell among
thorns meant that sometimes when men have been taught
about God, they let the love of money and the cares of life
and its pleasures fill their minds so that they have no time or
thought to give to God, or to read and pray. Those seeds
that fell on good ground meant the children or men who listen
to God's Word, and read it, and pray to Him for help, and
try to obey it. These grow better and better, and God will
love and help them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Our Lord was often very tired when He had been making
sick people well and teaching them by these lovely stories;
and then He would go up a mountain alone and pray to
His Father in Heaven, or cross the sea to some other place,
for He had hardly time to eat or sleep. One day He was
very tired and the sun had set, so He said to His disciples,
"Let us cross to the other side." Then they sent away the
crowd of people and took Jesus in the ship, and put out to
sea, and there were with them many other little ships.</p>

<p>And there arose a great wind; the waves were high and
beat into the boat, so that it was full of water and going to
sink; but Our Lord was fast asleep, with his head on a pillow,
in the stern of the ship. The disciples were much afraid, and
they woke him, saying, "Lord, do you not care that we
perish?" Then Jesus rose and stood up and spoke to the
wind and waves, and said, "Peace"&mdash;that is, Hush!&mdash;"be
still." And the wind stopped blowing, and the waves grew
still, and there was a great calm. Then the disciples said to
each other, "What kind of man is this, that even the wind
and the sea obey Him?" They ought to have known, for
they had seen Him raise the dead. You know, do you not?
He was the Son of God.</p>

<div class="caption">CHRIST STILLING THE TEMPEST.</div>
</div>

<p>Our Lord chose twelve of the men who followed Him to
be his apostles, and He sent seventy of His disciples out to
teach, and gave them power to make sick people well. The
apostles also, were sent, but after a time they came back to
Our Lord, and told Him all that they had done and taught.
And He said to them, "Come ye apart into a desert place
and rest awhile," for there were many coming and going, and
they had not even time to eat. And they went by ship with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a><br /><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>Him to a desert place near a city called Bethsaida. But
when the people found out where He had gone, they came in
crowds after Him. Our Lord was very kind to them. He
went to this desert place to rest, but He did not care for rest
or food, if He could do good, so He did not say, "Why did
you come here?" but He went up on a mount and told them
about God, and made all the sick ones well. And when the
day began to wear away, the twelve apostles came to Him,
and said, "Send this great crowd away that they may go to
the towns near and get food, for this is a desert place." Then
Jesus said to Philip, "Where shall we get bread that these
may eat?" And this He said to try him, for He Himself
knew what He would do. And Philip said, "A great deal
of bread would not be enough to give each of them a little
piece." Then Andrew said, "There is a lad here who has
five barley loaves and two small fishes, but what are they
among so many?" And Jesus said, "Make the men sit
down." And they sat down on the grass, fifty in one place,
and there were five thousand men there. Then Jesus took
the loaves, and when He had given thanks He broke them,
and gave the pieces to His disciples, and they gave them to
the people; and He gave them of the fishes as much as they
would, and they all ate and left many pieces. Then Our
Lord told the Apostles to gather the pieces up so that nothing
might be lost; for Jesus does not like people to waste things,
and they picked up enough pieces to fill twelve baskets with
the bread that was left. Was not this a very great miracle?
The people who saw it said at once, that Our Lord was the
Christ that was to come, and they wanted to make Him a
King; and when He would not be one, they thought they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
would take Him by force and crown Him; but Jesus sent
His disciples away and went into a mountain all by Himself
and prayed to His Father. This miracle made the people
believe in our Lord more than any other. They thought
that He Who could feed them when they were hungry,
must be the promised Saviour; and they had been taught
by the priests that when Christ came He would be a king,
that He would free them from the Romans and make them
rich and great. That was a great mistake. The Christ
was coming to set them free from their sins, and bring
them to His Heavenly Kingdom, not only to do them good
on earth.</p>

<p>And when the sun had set the disciples were on the sea,
and it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them. The
wind blew, and the great waves rose. How they must have
wished Our Lord had been there to hush the storm. But
Jesus saw them, and in the middle of the night He went to
them; He had no boat so He walked on the sea. Can
men walk on the sea? No; but Our Lord could, because
He was God. When the disciples saw Him, they were
afraid, and cried out. But Jesus spoke to them at once, and
said, "Fear not, it is I." And Peter said, "Lord, if it is
You tell me to come to You on the sea." And Jesus said,
"Come." Peter stepped out of the boat and walked on the
water to go to Jesus, but when he saw the great waves, he
was afraid and began to sink; and he cried out, "Lord, save
me." Then Jesus at once put out His hand, and caught
him, and said, "O why have you so little faith!" And
when they had both got into the boat, the wind left off
blowing, and the ship was at the place they were going to at
once. Then those in the ship came and knelt down to Jesus,
and said, "Of a truth, Thou art the Son of God."</p>

<p>One day, Our Lord was with His apostles near the
place where the Jews' land joined that of the people who did
not know about God. And a poor woman of that country
followed Him, and cried after Him, "Have mercy on me,
O Lord, Thou Son of David, for my daughter is very ill."
But He did not answer her; and so she kept crying to Him
till the apostles said, "Send her away, for she crieth after
us." They wanted Our Lord to cure her child, so that she
might go away. But Jesus said, "I am not sent to any but
the Jews."</p>

<div class="caption">OUR LORD AND THE WOMAN OF CANAAN.</div>
</div>

<p>Then the woman came and kneeled down to Him, and
said, "Lord, help me." And Jesus said, "It is not right
to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs." Did
not Our Lord seem unkind? But He was not; He
was only trying the woman's faith. But she was very
humble; she said, "That is true, Lord, but the dogs eat
of the crumbs that fall from their master's table." Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Jesus said, "O woman, great is thy faith, be it unto thee
even as thou wilt;" and her daughter was made well that
very hour.</p>

<p>This woman was at first of the Greek religion; that is, she
had worshipped and prayed to idols of stone, whom she called
Jove and Apollo and Diana. But she had heard of the
God of the Jews, and we think had given up her false gods
and believed in Him; for she knew of the expected Christ,
and that he would be of David's family. Then her dear
child was ill, and she went to Jesus for help. Very great
was her faith, as Our Lord said.</p>

<p>This was the second miracle Our Lord did for people
who were not Jews, but who had learned to believe in God.</p>

<p>Our Lord was often spoken to as He went on His way
by people who thought they would like to be His disciples,
but had not faith enough in the end to give up the things
they loved to go with Him. Once a man said to Him,
"I will follow You wherever You go." And Jesus said,
"Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but I,
the Son of Man, have not where to lay My head." For the
Lord Jesus was very poor; He had no home then on earth.
He stayed, we read, sometimes in Peter's house, and with
other friends of whom we shall tell you by-and-by. We do
not know if the man who spoke still wished to follow Christ;
we fear he did not, or we should have heard he did.</p>

<p>Another day as He was going on His way, a young man
ran up to Him, kneeled down, and said, "Good Master, what
good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?" And Jesus
said, "Why do you ask Me concerning that which is good?<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>One there is who is good; but, if you would enter into life
keep God's Commandments." The young man asked
"Which?" Jesus said, "Thou shalt not kill; thou shalt
not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness; honour thy father
and mother; thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." The
young man said, "I have kept all these; what is wanting in
me?" And Our Lord looking on him loved him, for he was
very good; but he had one great fault, he loved money, and
Jesus said, "If you would be perfect, go and sell what you
have and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in
Heaven; and come, and follow Me."</p>

<p>But when the young man heard this he went away
sorrowful, for he had great riches, and he did not like to
part with them and go about poor with Our Lord's disciples.
We are sure that Jesus was sorry for him, and we hope he
came back afterwards, but we do not know. Poor young man!
he was so good that we think perhaps in the end he did.</p>

<p>Our Blessed Lord went through every city and village
telling them the glad tidings of the Kingdom of God, and
the twelve apostles were with Him. There were some
women with them also whom Christ had made well. One
was called Mary Magdalene, who had been cured of a sad
disease, and Joanna, the wife of Herod's steward, and
Susannah, and many others, who brought Our Lord and
His apostles food, and did all they could to serve Him.</p>

<p>Jesus had many friends as well as cruel enemies.</p>

<p>There were some good people who lived at Bethany, a
pretty little village near Jerusalem. They were two sisters
and a brother, called Martha, Mary, and Lazarus. When
Our Lord was at Jerusalem, He often went to see them; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
they were very glad to have Him in their house. Martha
bustled about to get a feast for Him and His apostles one
day when He came there; but Mary sat at his feet listening
to His words. Then Martha thought her sister ought to
help her, so she came, and said, "Lord, do you not care
that my sister has left me to serve alone? Bid her help me."
But Jesus said to her, "Martha, Martha, you are careful
and troubled about many things; there is only one thing
needful; and Mary has chosen that good part that shall not
be taken away from her."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus59.jpg" width="600" height="328" alt="by Butterworth" />
<div class="caption">JESUS WITH MARY AND MARTHA.</div>
</div>

<p>Jesus was not angry with Martha; He only told her not
to be so full of care about earthly things, but to care most
for listening to His words. We cannot hear Christ's voice
now, but we can hear and read His words still. Do you
know where they are found? In the Bible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Our Lord prayed a great deal. Sometimes He prayed
all night long; He loved to pray to His Father in Heaven.
And one day He told a pretty story to His disciples to
teach them how to pray.</p>

<p>Two men went into the Temple to pray. One was a
Pharisee, the other a publican. The Pharisee stood and
prayed, and said, "God, I thank Thee that I am not as bad
as other men, or even as this publican; I obey Thy law."
The publican stood a great way off and would not lift up
so much as his eyes unto Heaven, but struck his breast
with his hand to show he was sorry, and said, "God be
merciful to me a sinner."</p>

<p>The Pharisee boasted how good he was; the publican
only asked God to forgive him. Which of the two prayed
best? Our Lord said the publican did; for God will not
hear the prayers of the proud, but listens to those of the
humble.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 465px;">
<img src="images/illus61.jpg" width="465" height="610" alt="by W. J. Webb" />
<div class="caption">THE PHARISEE AND THE PUBLICAN.</div>
</div>

<p>The Lord Jesus has told us that God will give us what
we ask for in prayer if we do not pray for wrong things. He
says, "Ask, and ye shall receive; seek, and ye shall find;
knock, and it shall be opened unto you." The meaning is,
If you ask God's help, He will give it; if you seek to find
out what is His will, you will find it; if you beg God to make
you understand His word, He will let you; for Our Lord
said, "If a son ask his father for bread, will he give him a
stone, or, if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?"&mdash;that is,
a snake. No; you know he will not. Since, then, even men
who are not good will be kind to their children, how much
more will your Heavenly Father give good things to them
who ask Him! The Lord loves to hear the prayer of a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
child. You may pray when you like; at your mothers knee,
or in the day if you feel you want God's help. He will hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
you if you say in your mind, "Make me a good child, for
Christ's sake."</p>

<p>One day a lawyer stood up from among the crowd who
listened to Our Lord and asked Jesus a question. He did
it to try the Lord and see if He would say something that
the priests might think wrong. He said, "Master, what
shall I do to gain eternal life"&mdash;that is, life in Heaven?
And Jesus said, "What is written in the law?" And the
lawyer said, "The law tells me that I must love the Lord
my God with all my heart, and with all my soul, and with all
my strength, and my neighbour as myself." Our Lord said,
"You have answered right; do this and live." But the
lawyer, not yet satisfied, asked, "Who is my neighbour?"
And Our Lord answered by telling him a pretty story.</p>

<p>A man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho: it was a
wild, lonely road over the hills; and he met some thieves
who robbed him, took off his clothes, wounded him, and left
him for dead by the road-side. And by chance a priest
came by that way but he did not help the poor man; he
crossed over to the other side of the way and went on.
Then, a Levite, one of the men who served the priests in the
Temple, came that way; he stopped and looked at the poor
man, and then left him and crossed to the other side of the
road.</p>

<p>Next, a Samaritan came along&mdash;you remember, do you
not, that the Jews hated the Samaritans?&mdash;but this man,
when he saw the poor wounded Jew lying in the road, had
pity on him. And he went to him and bound up his wounds,
putting oil and wine to them, as people used then to do; and
he lifted him off the hard ground and put him on his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
beast and brought him to
an inn and took care of him.
And the next day, when he
had to go away, he called
the host&mdash;that is, the man
who kept the inn&mdash;and gave him two pence&mdash;which were worth
more than a shilling&mdash;and said, "Take care of the poor man,
and whatever you spend I will repay you when I come again."</p>

</div>

<p>"Which of these three men do you think was neighbour
to the man who fell among thieves?" asked Our Lord.
And the lawyer could not help answering, "He that had
mercy on him."</p>

<p>Then Jesus said to him, "Go and do the same."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>One day Our Lord told His disciples of what would
happen soon, how He must go up to Jerusalem and die
for them and for all the world; and that made them very
sad.</p>

<p>About eight days after, He took Peter and James and
John with Him and went up a high mountain to pray. It
was late, and the disciples were tired, and while Jesus
prayed they fell asleep. But a great light woke them, and
then they saw a wonderful thing. Our Lord's face shone
like the sun, and His robe was white and glittering as the
light; and two men stood by Him in shining white robes;
and the apostles knew that they were Moses and Elijah.
Moses had been dead very, very long, and Elijah had been
taken up to Heaven alive; but now, like two bright angels,
they talked with Our Lord. What did they talk about? Of
how Jesus would go up to Jerusalem and die to save men.
The disciples could not quite tell what it meant, and Peter
said, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. Let us make here
three tents for Thee and Moses and Elijah," not knowing
what he said; but, as he spoke, a bright cloud came over
them, and they were taken into it, and a voice came out of
the cloud and said, "This is My Beloved Son; hear Him."
And when the voice was past, Jesus was alone. It was He
who was God's Dear Son.</p>

<p>Soon after this the disciples began to talk together about
which of them should be greatest in the Kingdom of
Heaven. And Jesus called a little child to Him, and when
He had taken him in His arms, He said to them, "Whoever
will receive one of such children in My name receiveth Me,
and whosoever shall receive Me receiveth not Me but Him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
that sent Me." And He told the apostles that they must
be as gentle and humble as little children if they would be
great in Heaven, for there the humble would be the first, and
the proud the last.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 560px;">

<div class="caption">JESUS AND THE LITTLE CHILDREN.</div>
</div>

<p>Our Lord loved little children very much. Soon after
this, some mothers brought their children and infants to
Jesus that He might touch and bless them; but the apostles
told them to go away and not to trouble the Lord. When
Jesus knew it He was very angry, and said, "Suffer little
children to come unto Me, and do not forbid them, for of
such is the Kingdom of God." And He took the little ones
in His arms, put His hands upon them, and blessed them.
How good and kind Jesus was! Little children ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
love Him with all their heart, and be very good to please
Him.</p>

<p>Our Lord came, you know, to bear the punishment of
our sins; and He told some pretty parables to the Pharisees
to try and make them understand why He talked so much
to bad men. It was because His great love made Him
wish to save them. He told them that if they had a great
many sheep and one was lost, the shepherd would leave all
the others and go to find the lost one; and when he had
found it he would bring it back with great joy.</p>

<p>And He said: "If a woman has ten pieces of silver and
she loses one she will light a candle and sweep the house
and look carefully for it. And when she has found it she
will call her friends, and say, Be glad with me; I have
found the piece that I had lost, so"&mdash;went on Our Lord&mdash;"there
is joy in Heaven with the angels of God over one
sinner that repenteth."</p>

<p>Once Our Lord told His disciples a parable of a fig-tree.
Fig-trees grow by the side of the road in that land, and
people might pick the figs. But this fig-tree grew in a man's
garden; and for three years it had borne no figs. Then the
master called his gardener and said to him, "For three
years I have come to find figs on this tree and there are none;
cut it down; it is of no use." But the gardener said, "Lord,
let it stay this year, I will dig round it and manure it, and if
next year it bears fruit, well; but if not, then you shall cut it
down."</p>

<p>This parable meant that Christ is always asking God,
His Father, to let us have time to be sorry for our sins before
we die. It meant, too, that He asked God to give the Jews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
time to be sorry before He destroyed their city and sent them
out of their own land.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Then He told them this other story: "Once, there was
a man who had two sons. The younger of the two said to
him one day, 'Father, give me now the share of your
money you mean me to have.' And the kind father divided
his money between the sons as the greedy one asked. As
soon as the younger son had his share he left his father's
house and went to a far off land, and there he spent his
money in eating and drinking with bad people. And when
he had spent all he had, great want came on that land; there
was very little food, and bread was very dear. Now this
sinful lad had no money left, so he was obliged to go and be
a servant to a man of that country, who sent him into his
fields to feed pigs; and he had so little food and was so
hungry that he would have liked to eat the husks the pigs
ate, and no man gave any food to him. Then he felt how
sinful he had been, and he said, 'My father's servants have
more bread to eat than they want, while I shall die of
hunger. I will go back to my father, and say to him,
"Father, I have sinned against God and against you, and
am not fit to be called your son; make me your servant."'
And he arose and went to his father; and when he was yet
a great way off his father saw him&mdash;a poor, ragged man&mdash;and
he ran to meet him, and fell on his neck, and kissed
him. And the son said, 'Father, I have sinned against
Heaven and against thee, I am not good enough to be
called thy son; let me be one of thy servants.' But his
father quite forgave him, and told the servants to bring the
best robe and put it on him, and to put shoes on his feet,
and a ring on his hand, and to cook the fat calf that they
might eat; and they were merry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, when the
elder son, who was
in the fields, heard
the sound of music
and dancing, and was
told what the feast
was for, he was angry,
and would not go in;
his father came out
and begged that he
would. But the son
said, 'I have been a
good son, but you did
not give me a kid that
I might make a feast
for my friends; yet,
now your wicked son
is come who has spent
all on bad living, you
have had the calf killed for him.' It was wrong of this son to
be jealous, was it not? He ought to have been glad that his
brother had come home again. But his father said, 'Son, you
are always with me, and all that I have is yours; but it was
right to be glad now, for your brother who was dead is alive
again, was lost, and is found.'"</p>

<div class="caption">THE RETURN OF THE PRODIGAL SON.</div>
</div>

<p>Jesus meant to teach us by this story that God will forgive
us and love us as soon as we are sorry for being
naughty. People who keep on being naughty are said in
God's Book to be dead and lost&mdash;and so they are&mdash;till they are
sorry and do better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Now it was winter-time, and a feast was being kept in
Jerusalem. Our Lord went to it, and walked in the Temple
in Solomon's Porch. Then the Jews came round about
Him, and said, "How long do You mean to keep us in
doubt"&mdash;to be in doubt is not to be sure of a thing&mdash;"If
You are Christ, tell us plainly?"</p>

<p>Jesus said, "I have told you, and you would not believe
Me. The works I do show that I am the Christ, but you
will not believe. Ye are not My sheep. My sheep hear
My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me, and I give
unto them eternal life, and no man can take them out of My
Father's hand. I and My Father are one."</p>

<p>The Jews knew that Our Lord meant to say that He
was God, for He was God's Son, and they were so angry
that they took up stones to throw at Him and sought to take
Him, but it was not yet time for Jesus to die for us all, so
He passed from them and went away to the other side of the
river Jordan, to the place where John baptized, and many
believed on Him there. John the Baptist was dead, another
cruel Herod had had his head cut off.</p>

<p>It was while Our Lord was here that a man was sent to
Him by Martha and Mary to say that Lazarus, their
brother, whom the Lord loved, was ill. The sisters thought
Jesus would be sure to come and make His dear friend well.
But, though Our Lord loved these good people, He did not
go at once. He waited for two days, and then He said to
His disciples, "Let us go into Judea again." But the
disciples said, "Master, the Jews of late tried to kill You;
why will You go there again?" Then Jesus said, "Our
friend Lazarus is asleep; I go that I may awake him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
They did not know what Jesus meant, so they said, "If he
is asleep he will get well." Then Our Lord told them that
Lazarus was dead, and said that He must now go to him.
The apostle Thomas said to the others, "Let us go, too,
that we may die with Him." For they thought the Jews
would be sure to kill Jesus if He went near Jerusalem;
and Martha and Mary lived very near it. Lazarus had
been buried four days when they arrived at Bethany.</p>

<p>As soon as Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went
out to meet him, and said to Him, "Lord, if You had been
here my brother would not have died; but I know that even
now if You ask God anything He will give it You." Jesus
said, "Thy brother shall rise again." "Yes; I know," said
Martha, "he will rise at the last day." But Jesus told her
that He could give life to the dead. Then He asked
for Mary. She was sitting with a great many friends who
had come to comfort her in her grief, but Martha made haste
to tell her that Our Lord was come; and Mary went out
to the Lord and said, as Martha had, "Lord, if You had been
here he would not have died." Then Jesus said, "Where
have you laid him?" The Jews had also come out now, and
they said, "Come and see." They were all weeping, and
Our Lord had such pity for their grief, that He too shed
tears. Now the grave was a place in a rock and a stone lay
upon it. Jesus said, "Take away the stone." And when
they had taken it away, Our Lord said some words to God
in heaven, and then He cried out with a loud voice, "Lazarus,
come forth." And the dead man came out alive, though he
had lain four days in the grave. How glad Mary and
Martha must have been! A great many of the Jews who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
were there, when they saw this wonderful thing, believed
that Jesus was the Son of God; but some of them went to
the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. And
they were angry, and said, "What shall we do? for if we let
this man alone all will believe in Him, and the Romans will
come and take away our place and nation." They meant
that the Romans would take them and sell them for slaves, as
was sometimes done in those days. Then the high priest
said, "One man must die for the people." He did not know
how true his words were, for Jesus meant to die to save all
men. But the Lord did not let them kill Him yet, He went
to another place with his disciples.</p>

<div class="caption">MARY ANOINTING THE FEET OF JESUS.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>However, as soon as the time of the Passover drew
near, He went up to Jerusalem, and then to Martha's
house, where Lazarus was; and Simon, who had been a
leper, made a supper for Him, and Martha waited on
Him; but Lazarus sat at the table. Then Mary took a
pound of very sweet-scented ointment, that cost a great deal
of money, and she put it on the feet of Jesus and wiped His
feet with her hair, and the scent went all over the house.</p>

<p>Now Jesus had one bad man among His apostles.
His name was Judas. He kept the bag in which Our Lord
and the disciples put their money, and he used to steal from it.
He was vexed when he saw Mary use the sweet ointment;
he could have sold it, he thought, and stolen the money if
she had given it to Our Lord, and not used it, so he said,
"That is a waste, the ointment could have been sold for a
great deal and the money given to the poor." But Jesus
said, "Let her alone; the poor you have always with you,
but Me ye have not always. She has done it for My
burial."</p>

<p>There were a great many Jews at this feast, they came
to see Lazarus who was raised from the dead, as well as
Jesus; and many of them believed in the Lord.</p>

<p>The priests then thought that they had better kill Lazarus
as well as Our Lord, and that very night Judas came to them,
and offered to help them take Jesus if they would pay him
for it. And they gave him some silver money for doing it&mdash;as
much as four of our sovereigns&mdash;just as much as people
paid for a slave.</p>

<p>Now the next day, when the people who had gone up to
Jerusalem for the feast, heard that Our Lord was coming,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
they went out to meet Him, with branches of palm-trees in
their hands, crying, "Blessed is the King that cometh in
the name of the Lord." Jesus had sent for a young ass
and was riding on it, and the people, to show how they
loved him, and that they would have Him for their King,
spread their garments on the ground for the ass to tread on.</p>

<div class="caption">THE ENTRY INTO JERUSALEM.</div>
</div>

<p>And when Our Lord was come near the city, and saw
it, He wept over it; He was very sorry that it was so
wicked, and He knew that God would destroy it.</p>

<p>They went on into Jerusalem, and the people wondered,
and said "Who is this?" And the crowd answered, "Jesus
of Nazareth!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">THE CHILDREN IN THE TEMPLE.</div>
</div>

<p>Then, Our Lord went into the Temple, and found there
the tables of money and the oxen and sheep as He had
before, and He drove them out again. The children, with
palms in their hands, had followed Him into the Temple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>,
and sang, with their sweet voices "Hosanna (that is, praise)
to the Son of David;" and when the priests heard them
they were angry, and said, "Do You hear what these
children say?" And Our Lord said, "Yes; have you never
heard that out of the mouth of babes and little infants God
has perfect praise?"</p>

<p>Then Jesus left them and went back to Martha's house,
where He slept.</p>

<p>For five days more, Our Lord came every morning
to Jerusalem, and went back in the evening to the house
of Lazarus to sleep. And He taught His apostles many
things, and talked with the Pharisees and priests in the
Temple. One day, when His disciples showed Him what
a grand place the Temple was, He told them that not one
stone would be left on another. And He said that one day
He would come again to judge the world.</p>

<p>One day, He saw a very poor woman&mdash;she was a widow&mdash;drop
two mites&mdash;that is, less than a farthing&mdash;into the box
that was placed for men to give money to the Temple.
And Jesus said to His disciples, "This poor widow has
cast in more than they all, for the rich men could spare all
they gave, but she has given to God all the living she
had."</p>

<p>You see, God does not mind how small the gift is that
we offer to Him, if it is all we can do; He loves the gift of
the poor.</p>

<div class="caption">THE WIDOW'S MITE.</div>
</div>

<p>One day some of the wicked people who wanted to find
fault with Him, came and asked Our Lord if it was right to
pay the tax to the Romans. Jesus said, "Show me a
penny;" and when they brought it He said, "Whose likeness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a><br /><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
is on it and what name?" They said, "CÃ¦sar's."
Then said Jesus, "Give to CÃ¦sar the things that are
CÃ¦sar's, and to God the things that are God's."</p>

<p>It was of no use to teach these men; they would not
believe though they heard how wisely Jesus spoke and saw
the wonderful works He did. Some of the chief rulers
believed on Him, but they were afraid of the Pharisees and
would not say that they did; for the Bible tells us they
loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</p>

<p>It was on one of the first days of this week, that some
Greeks came to the Apostle Philip and said, "Sir, we wish
to see Jesus." Philip told Andrew, and they went together
to tell Our Lord. Jesus said that the hour was come that
He should be glorified, and He spoke to the Greeks, and
told them that if any man served Him, God would honour
him; and ended His words by saying, "Father, glorify Thy
Name," and there came a voice from heaven, saying, "I have
both glorified it and will glorify it again." Some of the
people who stood by said that it thundered; but others&mdash;perhaps
the Greeks, who were nearer&mdash;said that an angel
spoke to Him. Our Lord told them that the voice came
not for Him but for their sakes. It was meant to make
them believe in Jesus, and these good Greeks must have
gone away sure now that He was indeed the expected
Christ.</p>

<p>Now, Our Lord had told the apostles to get Him a
room in which He would eat the Passover with them,
and, when they were there, Our Lord took a towel and
poured some water into a basin and began to wash His
disciples' feet, and wipe them with the towel. But, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
He came to Peter, Peter said, "Lord, Thou shalt not wash
my feet."</p>

<p>He thought it was not fit that Our Lord should do as a
servant would.</p>

<p>But Jesus said, "If I do not wash you, you have no part
in Me." Then Peter let Him do it. Why did Our Lord
wash His apostles' feet? To show us that we must not be
too proud to do anything for one another.</p>

<p>Then Our Lord sat down to supper, and He was
troubled, and said, "One of you will give Me up to the
priests." And the disciples looked at one another and
wondered which of them would be so wicked. Peter made
signs to John, who was close to Our Lord, to ask Him;
and John did. And Jesus said, "The one to whom I shall
give a sop when I have dipped it." And He dipped a
piece of bread in some sauce and gave it to Judas, and said
to him, "What you are going to do, do quickly." Then,
Judas, who knew what Our Lord meant, went out; but the
others did not know; they thought Our Lord sent him to
give something to the poor.</p>

<p>We shall not tell you all Our Lord did and said at this
Last Supper; it would be too hard for you to understand;
but we will tell you that He grew sad and told His apostles
that they would all leave Him that night. Peter said,
"Lord, I will go with Thee to prison or to death." Our
Lord answered, "I tell you, Peter, before the cock crows
you will three times say you do not know Me."</p>

<p>When the supper was ended and they had sung a hymn,
they went out to the Mount of Olives; and on the way the
Lord talked to them, and told them to love one another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus80.jpg" width="600" height="349" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">THE GARDEN OF GETHSEMANE.</div>
</div>

<p>Now, on that Mount, there was a garden called Gethsemane;
Our Lord went into it, and with Him He took
Peter and James and John, and told them to watch while
He prayed. They were tired, and only kept awake a little
while; but they heard Our Lord pray. He was very
sorrowful, for He knew He must die, and He was sad
because men were so wicked; but He said to God, "Not
My will, but Thine be done;" and His Father sent an
angel from Heaven to comfort Him. Twice Jesus went to
His apostles and found them asleep. It must have seemed
very unkind of them; but Our Lord was not angry. He
said they could not help it, they were so tired. But the
third time He came to them He told them to rise, for Judas
was coming with the priests to take Him.</p>

<p>And just then the priests came with soldiers and lamps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
for it was night, and Judas was with them. He said, "I
will show you which is Jesus; I will kiss Him." So he
went up to Our Lord, and said, "Hail, Master," and kissed
Him. Jesus said, "Judas, betrayest thou the Son of Man
with a kiss." Then He said to the soldiers, "Whom seek
ye?" They said, "Jesus of Nazareth." Our Lord said,
"I am He," and they fell on their faces before Him; they
felt how great He was. But they soon got up, and when
Our Lord said again, "Whom seek ye?" and they answered,
"Jesus," He said, "I am He; but let My disciples go."
Now Peter had a sword, and he was so angry that he drew
it and cut off the ear of one of the high priest's servants.</p>

<p>But Our Lord told him to put up his sword, and touched
the ear of the wounded man and made it well at once. Was
not Jesus good and kind to heal the man who came to take
Him? Then all His disciples forsook Him and fled; and
the soldiers led Him to the High Priest's house, where all the
wicked priests and scribes were sitting up waiting for Him.
John and Peter were soon sorry that they had left Our Lord,
and went after Jesus. John had a friend in the High Priest's
house who let him go in; and then John went and brought
Peter in. The priests were very cruel to Our Lord; they
told falsehoods about Him. But when they asked Him
if He was the Christ, and He said, "I am, and you will see
Me one day sitting on the right hand of God, and coming in
the clouds with the Holy Angels," they were so angry
that they tore their clothes, and said, "He ought to die."
And then they began to ill-treat Our Lord, and threw a
cloth over His face and beat Him with the palms of their
hands, and said, "Tell us who struck You!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 557px;">
<img src="images/illus82.jpg" width="557" height="381" alt="people around fire, man accusing Peter" />
<div class="caption">"THIS FELLOW WAS WITH JESUS."</div>
</div>

<p>Now Peter sat in the part of the great hall that was
lower down than that where Our Lord was, and he warmed
himself by the fire; and a maid came up, and said to him,
"You are one of the men who were with Jesus;" but he
said, "I do not know Him." Then another servant said
to him, "You are one of His disciples;" but Peter said,
"Man, I am not." An hour went by, and then another
said, "This fellow was with Jesus." And Peter said he
was not, and began to use bad words. Just then the cock
crowed; and Our Lord turned and looked at Peter. It
must have been such a sad look! and it reminded him of
what Our Lord had said, "Before the cock crow thou shalt
deny Me three times." And he was so much ashamed and
so very sorry that he went out and wept bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, when Judas saw that Our Lord would be put to
death, he repented, and brought back the thirty pieces of
silver to the chief priests, and said, "I have sinned, for I
have given up to you an innocent man." The wicked
priests answered, "What is that to us? See thou to that."
And Judas cast down the pieces of silver and went and
hanged himself. Very bad men sometimes cannot bear to
live, when they feel how wicked they have been; but it only
adds to their sins to kill themselves; for God has said men
may not do so.</p>

<p>When daylight came, the great crowd of the priests and
scribes and their friends led Our Lord from the High
Priest's house to that of Pilate, the Roman governor, to
have Him judged; for the Romans did not allow the Jews
to put any one to death. Pilate was in his hall where he
judged people. He came out and asked, "What has this Man
done?" "He teaches men wrong," said they; "He tells
them not to pay the tax to CÃ¦sar, and says that He is
Christ, a King." Then, Pilate went back to the judgment
hall and had Christ brought before him, and said, "Are You
a King?" Our Lord told him that He was; but not a
king of this world; His Kingdom was a heavenly one.
Then Pilate went out to the people, and said, "I find no
fault in this man." But they were more angry, and cried,
"He teaches the people wrongly, from Galilee to this place."
When Pilate found that Jesus came from Galilee, he sent
Him to Herod to be judged, for Herod was ruler over
that part of the land. And when Herod saw Our Lord, he
was glad, for he hoped to see some miracle done by
Him; and he questioned Jesus with many words; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Lord would not even speak to the cruel man who had killed
John the Baptist. Then Herod grew angry, and he and
his soldiers mocked the Lord, and put on Him a purple
robe such as kings wear, and sent Him back to Pilate.
The priests and scribes then said all manner of false things
about Jesus; but He did not speak or answer at all. Then
Pilate's wife sent to tell him not to have anything to do with
that just man, as she had had a terrible dream about Him.
And again Pilate tried to save Him. The Romans set free
any prisoner that the Jews asked for at the Passover; so
Pilate said to them, "I will have Jesus beaten and then
set Him free." But the priests told the people to say, "No;
set Barabbas free." Now, Barabbas was a robber.</p>

<p>Then Pilate said, "What, then, shall I do with Jesus
who is called Christ?" and they said, "Crucify Him!"&mdash;that
is, "Nail Him to a cross." But Pilate still tried to
save Jesus; he told his soldiers to beat Our Lord with great
knotted ropes; and then the men made a crown of sharp thorns
and pressed it on His head, so that the blood ran down;
and they put a reed in His hand, and the purple robe on
again, and cried, "Hail, King of the Jews!" and kneeled
down to Him, mocking Him. Pilate, thinking that the
cruel Jews would be quiet and let Him go if they saw Him
thus, took Him out, and said to them, "Behold the Man!"
But they only cried more and more, "Crucify Him!" Pilate
said, "Take ye Him and crucify Him, for I find no fault in
Him." They answered, "We have a law, and by our law
He ought to die, because He says He is the Son of God."</p>

<p>When Pilate heard that, he was much afraid; he took
Our Lord back into the hall, and asked Him, "Whence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
do you come?" But Jesus did not answer him. Pilate
said, "Why do you not answer me? Do you not know that
I can crucify you, or let you go free?" But Jesus said that
Pilate's power was given from above, and that the Jews had
the greater sin. Then Pilate tried very hard to save the
Lord, but the Jews cried out again, "If you let this Man
go, you are not CÃ¦sar's friend."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 566px;">
<img src="images/illus85.jpg" width="566" height="386" alt="PIlate washing his hands" />
<div class="caption">"I AM INNOCENT OF THE BLOOD OF THIS JUST MAN."</div>
</div>

<p>And Pilate was much afraid of CÃ¦sar, who was a cruel
man. Then the Jews began to make a great disturbance;
but Pilate took water, and washed his hands before them,
and said, "I am innocent of the blood of this just Man; see
ye to it." Was this true? No. Pilate ought to have
rather died himself than let a good man be killed. But fear
often makes men wicked. Be ashamed to be a coward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the soldiers took the robe off Christ, and put His
own clothes on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him.
At first they made Him carry the great cross on which He
was to be nailed; but He fainted under the weight and fell,
and then they made a man they met carry it for Him.</p>

<p>They nailed the dear Lord's hands and feet to the cross;
but first they wanted Him to drink some wine and myrrh
that He might not feel the pain so much, but He would not
drink it. Now, the mother of Jesus stood by the cross with
his favourite apostle, John. How sad it was for her to see
her dear Son in such pain! But Jesus still thought of her.
He looked at John, and said, "Woman, behold thy son;"
and to John He said, "Behold thy mother;" and from that
hour John was a good son to the mother of his Lord.</p>

<p>Then Our Lord prayed to God for the cruel Jews. He
said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they
do"&mdash;that is, they did not know that He was God's Son.
There were two thieves crucified with Christ, one on each side.
One of them was wicked; the other was sorry for his sin, and
asked Jesus to forgive him. The Lord told him, "To-day you
shall be with Me in Paradise"&mdash;the happy place, you know.
Then a great darkness came on like night, and there was a
hush&mdash;the cruel Jews had been mocking Our Lord; now, they
were frightened. The darkness lasted for three hours; then
light came back. Our Lord said, "I thirst." And the
soldiers dipped a sponge in vinegar, and put it on a reed and
held it to His lips. When He had tasted it, He said, "It
is finished!" and bowed His head and died. Then the earth
and the city shook, and the Roman Captain, close by, said,
"This Man really was the Son of God."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>The Jews asked Pilate to take Our Lord and the others
down from the crosses, because the next day was their Sabbath.
So he sent to see if they were dead. Jesus was, but, to make
sure, one of the soldiers stabbed His side with a spear.
The thieves were not dead; so their legs were broken, that
when taken down they might not get away, and die sooner.</p>

<p>Then a rich man, named Joseph, begged Pilate to let
him bury Our Lord, and Pilate said he might. So Joseph,
and Nicodemus, who came to Jesus by night, wrapped Him
in white linen and put Him in a grave that Joseph had made
for himself in a garden, and a great stone was put for a door
to it. The Jews begged Pilate to set a guard upon the tomb
for fear the disciples should take the Lord away; for they
remembered that He had said He would rise again. So
Pilate sent a great many soldiers to watch. But at day-dawn
an angel of the Lord came down from Heaven: his face was
bright as the lightning, and his robe as white as snow; and
the earth shook very much as he came down. He rolled
away the stone that shut the tomb, and sat on it. The guards
were nearly dead with fear, and made haste away.</p>

<p>Now, the women who loved the Lord were coming to put
sweet spices on Him, even while it was dark. But when
they came, they saw that the stone was rolled away, and that
the grave was empty; so Mary Magdalene ran off at once to
tell Peter and John of it. The other women went and looked
into the tomb, and there they saw two bright angels, and they
were afraid. But the angels said, "Do not be afraid. We
know you are looking for Jesus; He is not here; He is risen.
Go and tell Peter and the disciples that He is risen." And
they made haste to take the message.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>And while they were going, some of the watch came into
the city and told the chief priests all that had been done;
how an angel had come down and rolled away the stone
from the tomb. The priests were afraid, and called the elders
together to ask their advice; it was that they should give a
great deal of money to the soldiers and tell them to say that
the disciples came in the night, and stole Our Lord's body
away while they were asleep, and this wicked thing they did.
They paid the Roman soldiers to tell a falsehood, and said
that they would
take care that
Pilate should not
punish them for
sleeping on their
watch; for which
they might be put
to death.</p>

</div>

<p>Then Peter and
John came with
Mary Magdalene,
and looked into
the tomb, but it was empty&mdash;only the linen lay folded
up on one spot. They were very much surprised,
but by-and-by they went home. Mary did not; she
stood crying by the tomb. Then she looked into the
grave, and she also saw the two angels. They said to
her, "Why do you weep?" She said, "Because they
have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where
they have laid Him." She turned back as she spoke,
and Jesus stood close by her, but she did not know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Him. He said, "Why do you weep?" Mary was crying so
much she could not see His face, and she thought He was
the gardener, so she said, "Sir, if you have taken my Lord
away, tell me where you have laid Him, and I will take Him
away." Jesus said, "Mary!" When she heard His voice
and her name, she knew who He was, and kneeled down to
Him. He told her to go and tell "His brothers"&mdash;the
disciples&mdash;that He had come out of the grave and would
soon go up to Heaven.</p>

<p>Then the Lord Jesus went and spoke to Peter, because
the kind Saviour knew how sad he was.</p>

</div>

<p>Two disciples that day were walking to a place eight
miles from Jerusalem. They were very sad, talking about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Our Lord, when He came up and walked with them; but
He did not let them know who He was. He asked them
why they were sad, and they told Him it was because Jesus
was dead. Then He made them understand that Jesus died
that they might go to Heaven, and they were quite glad of
what He said. They begged Him to go in with them to
supper, and He went in; and when He took bread and
blessed it they knew Him at once. But He passed away,
they could not tell how, so they made haste to go back to
Jerusalem to tell the Apostles. They found them all, except
Thomas, in one room, with the doors shut, but before they
could tell their tale, the men said, "Our Lord has risen from
the dead, and has been seen by Peter." Then the two told
how He had walked with them; and while they spoke Jesus
stood in the midst of them, and said, "Peace be to you;" and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
He showed them the holes of the nails in His hands and feet.
Then they knew that it was the Lord. They told Thomas
of it, but he was so sad he could not believe them. "You
must make a mistake," he said; "I will not believe Our Lord
is alive again unless I can put my hand in His side, where
the spear went in, and my fingers in the holes of the nails."</p>

<div class="caption">OUR LORD APPEARING TO THOMAS.</div>
</div>

<p>The next first day of the week&mdash;Sunday&mdash;they were all
in the room, Thomas too, when Our Lord came into the
midst of them, and said to Thomas, "Put out your hand
and feel my side, and put your fingers in the nail-holes."
Then Thomas kneeled down and said, "My Lord and my
God." Jesus said, "Thomas, because you have seen Me
you believe; blessed are they who have not seen, and yet
have believed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Our Lord stayed forty days on earth, and often came and
talked to His disciples; once He came to five hundred all in
one place. But some of the apostles went back to their boats.
There were together Peter, James and John, Thomas,
Nathanael, and two other disciples. They went out to fish;
but all night they did not catch one, and when day broke
Jesus stood on the shore. They did not know Him, and
He asked if they had any fish. They said, "No;" and then
He told them to cast their net on the right side of the ship.
They did so, and now the net nearly broke with the weight
of the fish. Then John said, "It is the Lord," and Peter at
once swam ashore to Jesus. The others came in the boat
dragging the net full of fish. And when they came to the
shore they saw a fire of coals and fish laid on it, and bread.
And Jesus told them to bring some of their own fish; there
were a hundred and fifty great ones in the net, but it did not
break. Then Jesus said, "Come and dine;" and He gave
them fish and bread. When they had dined, the Lord said
to Peter, "Do you love Me more than these?" Peter said,
"Yes, Lord; You know that I love You." Then Christ said,
"Feed My lambs." Again He asked Peter, "Do you love
Me?" "Yes, Lord," said Peter. Then said Jesus, "Feed My
sheep." A third time He asked Peter, "Do you love Me?"
Peter was grieved because Jesus asked him three times; he
thought Our Lord remembered that he had three times said
he did not know Him, and he said, "Lord, You know all
things; You know that I love You." Then Jesus said,
"Feed My sheep." Who are Christ's lambs? Little
children, whom Jesus loves; to feed the sheep and lambs
means to teach them.</p>

<div class="caption">OUR LORD APPEARING TO THE DISCIPLES.</div>
</div>

<p>Then Jesus said to Peter, "When you were young you
walked where you would; but when you are old you shall
stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you and
carry you where you do not wish to go." Jesus thus foretold
Peter's death; who, when old, was crucified. Peter
asked Our Lord what John would do&mdash;you remember that
John and Peter were great friends&mdash;and Jesus gently reproved
him for asking, by saying, "If I will that he tarry till I come,
what is that to thee?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Our Lord also told His disciples to go all over the
world and tell people about Him, and baptize them; and
then He took them out to the Mount of Olives, and, while
He was blessing them, He was taken up, and a cloud hid
Him from their sight; but they stood a long time looking up
after their Lord, till two angels came to them, and said,
"Why do you stand looking up into Heaven? This same
Jesus who is taken up from you into Heaven will come again
in the same way as you have seen Him go up." Then the
disciples were very glad, and they went back to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Has not the story of Our dear Lord made you love
Him? We hope so; and if you love Him you will be
a good child to please Him, for He sees you now from
where He sits at God's right hand, whence He will come
by-and-by and&mdash;if you obey Him&mdash;will take you to live
with Him in Heaven.</p>
